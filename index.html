				<p>Over past few decades, there have been great advances in science and medicine that have lead
					to cures and treatments for many previously uncurable diseases. While this has gone a long way to improving the health of
					the country on a whole, increasing life expectancy and other metrics of health, it has created a new cause of health inequality:
					wealth. As you can see from the interactive charts to the right, spending on health care has increased at an incredible rate, and most
					of this increase is due to health insurance - specifically, private health insurance. This means that there now exists a large gap
					in life expectancy between wealthier people, who can afford good health insurance, and poorer ones who cannot.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, all states within the US do not provide adequate levels of health care access to all of its residents. This can have a great negative impact for
					ultimate health care outcomes, contributing to the ultimate health inequalities we see within the United States. Check out the quartile-ranking of the US states for
					health care access metrics (percentage of adults who don't have a regular doctor & percentage of uninsured adults), and how this corresponds to health care outcome metrics
					(infant death rate, patients' reports of their own health). What would happen if all states performed as well as the top state for these indicators?</p>
